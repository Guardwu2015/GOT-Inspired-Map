# GOT-Inspired-Map
A GOT-inspired map style and files

Winter is here! Weâ€™re pretty amped for the final season of Game of Thrones. Since we love GOT and love making maps, we thought we'd combine the two with this Game of thrones-inspired map style. 

Bring this style directly into you Mapbox Studio account here: []
