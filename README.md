# GOT-Inspired-Map
A GOT-inspired map style and files

Winter is here! We’re pretty amped for the final season of Game of Thrones. Since we love GOT and love making maps, we thought we'd combine the two. 

We decided to play around with a cool Game of thrones-inspired map style. You can access the map style in Studio here: 
https://www.mapbox.com/studio/styles/add-style/mapbox/cjuah12up9qs41fo96ruvf7x8/?utm_medium=community&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=community|github|mobile|GOT-Inspired-map-19-05&utm_term=mobile&utm_content=GOT-Inspired-map		

This repo contains the hard files underlying our style if you're rather build from scratch: TheMountainGoat’s open dataset, some open source Google fonts, and a couple additional datasets we tweaked. 

Publish your finished map and share it with us on twitter #builtwithmapbox.
